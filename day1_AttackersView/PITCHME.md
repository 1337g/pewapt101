Version 1Q14

Note:
Web applications are a major point of vulnerability in organizations today. Web app holes have resulted in the theft of millions of credit cards, major financial and reputational damage for hundreds of enterprises, and even the compromise of thousands of browsing machines that visited web sites altered by attackers.
In the next few days, you'll learn the art of exploiting web applications, so you can find flaws in your enterprise's web apps before the bad guys do. Through detailed, hands-on exercises and these materials, you will be taught the four-step process for web application penetration testing. You will inject SQL into back-end databases, learning how attackers exfiltrate sensitive data. You will utilize Cross Site Scripting attacks to dominate a target infrastructure in our unique hands-on laboratory environment. And, you will explore various other web app vulnerabilities in-depth, with tried-and-true techniques for finding them using a structured testing regimen. As well as the vulnerabilities, you will learn the tools and methods of the attacker, so that you can be a powerful defender.

## Lab Set up

- You will receive 2 DVDs
- They contain two zip files and a readme
- Extract both zip files
- One from each DVD
- Launch them by double-clicking the .vmx file
- VMware will ask if VM was moved
- Select "I Moved It"
- *Both images need to be running during ALL exercises!*

Note:
You will receive two DVDs.  (Unless they were shipped with your books)  On disk one, there is a README.txt file and a zip that contains the target VM.  Extract this file to a location on your hard drive.  On disk two is the samuraiWTF zip file.  Extract this one to another place on your hard drive.  We recommend that you place both into directories under a PEWAPT101 directory to keep them together.

Run both virtual machines by clicking on their respective .vmx files. If the VM was moved or copied, select “I moved it” when VMware prompts you.

Make sure that both VMs are running during every exercise.

Unless instructed otherwise, do ALL exercises in the SamuraiWTF VM.
